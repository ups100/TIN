After starting the client application, user can create an alias or join to existing one. He can also add or remove local directory. After client logged successfully, he can list all files, files only gathered locally or only away from user's computer. Commands like Push or Pull are allowed only after listing files - respectively Pull after listing away files, Push after typing list local files. Syntax of the commands:

create <login> <password>
Possible after connection with server was established

Add <login> <password> <absolute path>
Adds directory to the alias. If login or password are incorrect, adding does not work.

Rm <login> <password> <absolute path>
Removes directory from the alias. If login or password are incorrect, removing does not work.

Change <path>
Changes path of actual working directory

Above commands are allowed to invoke before logging to alias. After logging to alias, these commands are allowed:

ls

ls -l 
Lists all files that are in current directory

ls -r
