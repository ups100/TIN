If you want to add your own plugin to Wireshark, you need to do plenty of things:


1. Install Wireshark
2. Let Wireshark be invoked by non-super users. To do this: put it into command line:
sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
And press yes in the pop-up

Then invoke each of this commands seperately (if you can run wireshark without typing sudo, you 
don't have to do that. But in case of errors, this is rather necessary):


sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin wireshark
sudo chgrp <your_name> /usr/bin/dumpcap
sudo chmod 750 /usr/bin/dumpcap
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip /usr/bin/dumpcap

If there is a need for some packages, install them

3.Check if Wireshark works without super user priviliges. If not, fix it :)
Now, you need to check if your version of Wireshark supports LUA. To do that, open Wireshark and in Help->About Wireshark should be written somewhere (in the Compiled acapit) with Lua 5.1. If there is "without LUA" get Wireshark that supports it 

4.Download LUA using command:
wget http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.2.0.tar.gz
Then
tar zxf lua-5.2.0.tar.gz
Get into that catalog and type
sudo make linux
sudo make install

There will probably be some problems with readline and ncursers lib so just install them

5.Ok, everything should be right. Now get the TIN_project.lua file and put it anywhere you want

6.Go to /etc/wireshark and open init.lua (with rights to write)

7.On the very end put PATH to file with TIN_project.lua and command dofile that uses this PATH. Ony my computer it looks like this:
TIN_project_SCRIPT_PATH="/home/marcin/"
dofile(TIN_project_SCRIPT_PATH.."TIN_project.lua")

Save changes

8.If everything is right, wireshark should open without any errors (it will probably mean, that the path to the .lua file is wrong) and if you type "tin_project" in filters, it should be recognized as valid filter.

That's it
