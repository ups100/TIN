To work with this code you should:

1. Install Boost library
2. Instal Qt library
3. Instal cmake (not too old version due to automoc)
4. Install Doxygen
5. Instal Graphviz
4. Instal Eclipse with CDT plugin

how to start:

1. clone repository to some folder
	git clone git@github.com:ups100/TIN.git

2. Add execute rights to setup.sh
	chmod +x setup.sh

3. Run setup.sh script. If there are some errors with libs fix them.

4. Open Eclipse IDE.

5. Import this project using:
	File > Import... > General/Exisiting Projects into Workspace

6. Select TIN directory as root directory and click Finish

7. If Everything is OK you may now build project from eclipse using Project > Build Project
 or from command line by invoking make from TIN/build directory

8. On most unixes there should be no problems but if there are some problems with QT edit 
QT_HEADERS_LOC eclipse variable and set it to place where you have qt headers,
but remember to not overwrite project settings while merging with master.

9. Results of building this project you may see in
	TIN/build/bin and TIN/build/lib 
There should be 3 executable: client, daemon, server and one static-linking library in lib directory.
There is also auto-generated documentation generated while bilding project. You may find it in:
	TIN/doc/html
(to see it open TIN/doc/html/index.html)

10. If you would like some class to inherit QObject and has a Q_OBJECT macro remember to add it's
header files to CMakeLists.txt for it module.

11. Remember to document class which you implement according do doxygen-style.
example:

/**
 * @brief foo brief
 *
 * @details foo details
 *
 * @param a description
 *
 * @param b description
 *
 * @return return description
 *
 * @throw description od exceptions
 *
 * @note some important info
 *
 * @warning some warning
 *
 * @see some link to things related with this function
*/
int foo(int a, int b)

for more tags see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html

12. Functions headers has been already corrected but there is a lot of rubbish (ie. some public pointers
generated by EA) so remember to not use them and clean up class which you implement.

13. There are autoformating setting added to project so you may now use Ctrl + Shift + f to autoformat your code

14. Before starting work with some class let me know, so we don't double our work.
